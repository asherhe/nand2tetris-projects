# LACK

So LACK is basically a file system that lacks a lot of features (hence the name). The whole file system is based on two objects: `File` and `Folder`, representing a file and a folder, respectively (that was obvious). A folder is essentially a collection of files and folders, and a file is a thing with a name and some contents.

When running the program, you will first see a blank screen, with a bar at the top that says "`root/`". This is your root directory. To create a new file, just press `N`. To create a folder, press `F`. Upon creating something, LACK will prompt you for the file/folder name. After naming the thing, depending on whether the thing is a file or folder, two things can happen. If the thing is a file, you will automatically go into the text editor, in which you can write the contents of a file. To save press `F1`. To exit, press `F2`. If the created object is a folder, your display will again be empty, but the address bar now says "`root/[folderName]/`.

Oh, and also, if you close your HACK computer, all your LACK files will cease to exist.
